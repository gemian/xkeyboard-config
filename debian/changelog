    changes can be tested for a while in unstable.
  * Update URL in watch file.
  * Add xsltproc, xutils-dev build-deps.

  * New upstream release:
    - Since 2.1 is still supposed to be the best for GNOME2, and since
      GNOME3 is still being prepared in experimental, target that suite
      rather than unstable.
  * Add intltool build-dep.

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Jun 2011 00:35:16 +0200

xkeyboard-config (2.2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Big rewrite for GNOME3.
  * By default, run-time dependencies are checked at build-time:
    - Pass --disable-runtime-deps to disable that check since there's no
      point in doing so for Debian packages.
    - Break earlier versions of libx11-6.
  * Get rid of old maintainer scripts to upgrade from 1.6 since squeeze
    has 1.8.
  * Refresh patches.
  * Switch to dh:
    - Bump debhelper build-dep/compat to 8.
    - Use dh-autoreconf.
    - Rewrite debian/rules accordingly.
    - Build out-of-tree.
  * Remove debian/xsfbs/, no longer needed.

xkeyboard-config (2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    + Beware of the possible regressions, we're going 3 releases forward
      at once.
  * Rebuild ChangeLog using “git log” on the upstream branch. The NEWS
    file is a bit too lightweight. As a reminder, it's installed as:
      /usr/share/doc/xkb-data/changelog.gz
  * Point to /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst in README.Debian, thanks to
    Riku Saikkonen for the suggestion (Closes: #487951).
  * Great debian/rules cleanup:
    + Remove deb target, dpkg-buildpackage's -i does the right thing, and
      “-rfakeroot” has been the default for a while.
    + Remove dir target, no longer used.
    + Stop removing rules/compat/base.l[2-4]*.part, they are no longer
      generated automatically.
    + More generically, stop removing files which weren't cleaned, that's
      been fixed.
    + Call touch in clean to restore the empty file which gets deleted by
      quilt when unpatching rules/base.o_k.part; this avoid its showing up
      as “deleted” in “git status”.
    + Try and keep the udeb's size low: Replace multiple spaces with a
      single space character. For this version, installed size goes down
      from 3.5MB to 3.0MB.
    + Additionally, remove comments starting with “//”. Down to 2.6MB, yay.
    + Also don't ship the newly-added pkg-config file in the udeb.
    + Stop removing $(xkb_base)/compiled, it's no longer created.
    + Stop passing --disable-xkbcomp-symlink to configure, it's gone.
  * Merge xsfbs/debian-unstable, which helps avoiding rebuilds.
  * Update download URL in watch file.
